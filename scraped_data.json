It shines a spotlight on how networks of women used radical ideas and rebellious methods to make an invaluable contribution to British culture. Their art helped fuel the women\u2019s liberation movement during a period of significant social, economic and political change.In the 1970s and 1980s a new wave of feminism erupted. Women used their lived experiences to create art, from painting and photography to film and performance, to fight against injustice. This included taking a stand for reproductive rights, equal pay and race equality. This creativity helped shape a period of pivotal change for women in Britain, including the opening of the first women's refuge and the formation of the British Black Arts Movement.Despite long careers, these artists were often left out of the artistic narratives of the time. This will be the first time many of their works have been on display since the 1970s.Through their urgent and powerful art visitors will encounter a productive, politically engaged set of communities, who changed the face of British culture and paved the way for future generations of artists.", "El Anatsui\u2019s Behind the Red Moon is a monumental sculptural installation made of thousands of metal bottle tops and fragments. Crumpling, crushing, and stitching them into different compositions, large panels are pieced together to form massive abstract fields of colour, shape and line. The commission builds on Anatsui\u2019s interest in histories of encounter and the migration of goods and people during the transatlantic slave trade. Sourced in Nigeria, the liquor bottle tops used in this commission form part of a present-day industry built on colonial trade routes. \u202fBehind the Red Moon is staged as an artwork in three acts. Visitors are invited to embark on a journey of movement and interaction through the hangings, a dance between bodies and sculptures.Viewing the hangings from afar, a landscape of symbols is revealed: the moon, the sail, the wave, the earth, and the wall. Up close, the bottle tops\u2019 logos speak to the material\u2019s social lives as commodities of a global industry built on colonial trade routes. Together, the past and present of Africa and Europe merge into sculptural forms that hang in the air and appear to float across the space. The hangings embody Anatsui\u2019s idea of the \u2018non-fixed form\u2019, and are part of his highly experimental approach to sculpture.Anatsui engages with the poetic possibilities of his materials. \u2018Each material has its properties, physical and even spiritual,\u2019 he explains. Behind the Red Moon explores elemental forces interwoven with human histories of power, oppression, dispersion and survival.", "The 2023 Turner Prize will be hosted by Towner Eastbourne as the centrepiece of the gallery\u2019s centenary programme.The prize is awarded to a British artist for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the preceding year as determined by a jury.The four shortlisted artists for the Turner Prize 2023 are:Jesse DarlingGhislaine LeungRory PilgrimBarbara WalkerFind out more in the Turner Prize 2023 press release.The exhibition of Turner Prize\u2019s four shortlisted artists will be presented from 28 September 2023 to 14 April 2024.It was announced in December 2023 that Jesse Darling was the winner of the Turner Prize 2023.Turner Prize 2023 is part of \u2018Towner 100\u2019 \u2013 the gallery\u2019s year-long centenary celebration of arts and culture across Eastbourne.

In this unique exhibition, we explore the dynamic relationship between the two mediums through some of the most iconic artworks of recent times.From the expressive paintings of Pablo Picasso and Paula Rego, to striking photographs by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Jeff Wall, you will see how these two distinct mediums have shaped each other over time.You will also discover how artists have blurred the boundaries between painting and photography, creating new and exciting forms of art, such as Pauline Boty's pop paintings, Andy Warhol\u2019s silkscreen prints, the photorealist works of Gerhard Richter, or Andreas Gursky's large-scale panoramic photographs.In an open-ended conversation between some of the greatest painters and photographers of the modern era, we explore how the brush and the lens have been used to capture moments in time.This exhibition is realised in collaboration with the YAGEO Foundation, Taiwan. The YAGEO Foundation was founded by Taiwanese collector, entrepreneur and philanthropist Pierre Chen in 1999.", "Tate presents a rare chance to experience two of Yayoi Kusama\u2019s Infinity Mirror Rooms. These immersive installations will transport you into Kusama\u2019s unique vision of endless reflections.Infinity Mirrored Room \u2013 Filled with the Brilliance of Life is one of Kusama\u2019s largest installations to date and was made for her 2012 retrospective at Tate Modern.

For Pieski, duodji is also a way of revitalising connections between past and future generations.Through this thought-provoking show, Pieski raises important questions around ancestral return, indigenous people\u2019s rights, and the relationship between humans, animals and nature.", "The Mobile Museum, a collaboration with Art Explora, Tate and MuMo, starts its second tour of the UK by bringing art to school children and young people, community groups, care home residents and adults from all backgrounds across the Midlands and the North.The Mobile Museum first toured across the Liverpool City Region, including St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton, Wirral and Halton in 2023.

Her endlessly inventive work, inspired by her memories and experiences, spanned monumental installations, figurative sculptures, fabric collages and drawings, a selection which feature in this exhibition.ARTIST ROOMS Louise Bourgeois focuses on works produced during the last 20 years of her life, a period of extraordinary creativity, during which Bourgeois re-imagined many of her lifelong concerns in works that explores identity, gender, motherhood, family and memory.

Inviting calm and contemplation, the viewer is immersed in the space within the image. Saleh uses recurring patterns and silhouettes to project layers of time and meaning onto her canvases. She alludes to narratives but rarely are they fully disclosed.", "Celebrated for his striking portrait paintings, this exhibition sheds new light on John Singer Sargent\u2019s acclaimed works. It explores how he worked like a stylist to craft the image of the sitters he painted, who he often had close relationships with.Sargent used fashion as a powerful tool to express identity and personality. He regularly chose the outfits of his collaborators or manipulated their clothing. This innovative use of costume was central to his artwork \u2013 for example, tugging a heavy coat tighter around a man to emphasise his figure or letting a dress strap sensuously slip from a woman\u2019s shoulder. It was these daring sartorial choices that allowed him to express his vision as an artist.Almost 60 of Sargent\u2019s paintings will be on display, including major portraits that rarely travel. Several period garments will also be showcased alongside the portraits they were worn in. The show examines how this remarkable painter used fashion to create portraits of the time, which still captivate today.Lead support with a generous donation from the Blavatnik Family Foundation.

Developing her practice in the United States, Japan and the UK, ideas are central to her art, often expressed in poetic, humorous,\u00a0profound\u00a0and radical ways.Spanning more than seven decades, YOKO ONO: MUSIC OF THE MIND is the UK\u2019s largest exhibition celebrating key moments in Ono\u2019s groundbreaking, influential and multidisciplinary career, from the mid-1950s to now \u2013 including her years in London where she met her future husband and longtime collaborator John Lennon.The show traces the development of her practice and explores some of Ono\u2019s most talked about and powerful artworks and performances.

Studzinski CBEThe exhibition is organised by Tate Modern, London in collaboration with Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf", "Tate St Ives presents a retrospective of the work of artist Beatriz Milhazes, who is known for intensely colourful, large-scale abstract canvases. The exhibition Beatriz Milhazes: Maresias traces the evolution of her artistic approach over the past four decades.Beatriz Milhazes (born 1960, Rio de Janeiro) rose to prominence in the 1980s as a leading figure of the Gera\u00e7\u00e3o Oitenta (1980s Generation), a pivotal Brazilian art movement that saw a return to painting as a dynamic medium for artistic expression, moving away from the conceptual art of the previous decade.Milhazes is influenced by multiple sources including Brazilian and European modernism, Catholic iconography, Baroque colonial architecture, and the vernacular culture and heritage of Brazil.Adapting the concept of collage to painting, Milhazes creates exuberant, densely layered works. In 1989 she developed her distinctive \u2018monotransfer\u2019 technique in which she paints her own motifs onto plastic sheeting before transposing them onto canvas. This process offers the possibility to retain the fidelity of the colours and intensify the effects of fluorescent and metallic pigments. It also allows Milhazes to create a smooth and defiant surface without losing the painterly quality.In Portuguese, Maresias refers to the salty sea breeze that is part of Milhazes\u2019 everyday life in the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, where she lives and works. Nature is an enduring and increasingly important theme, and she finds inspiration in the landscapes around her studio, as well as in the forms and structures of the natural world.Organised by and originated at Turner Contemporary, Margate, and adapted for presentation at Tate St Ives.", "Spanning 400 years, this exhibition follows women on their journeys to becoming professional artists. From Tudor times to the First World War, artists such as Mary Beale, Angelica Kauffman, Elizabeth Butler and Laura Knight paved a new artistic path for generations of women. They challenged what it meant to be a working woman of the time by going against society\u2019s expectations \u2013 having commercial careers as artists and taking part in public exhibitions.Including over 150 works, the show dismantles stereotypes surrounding women artists in history, who were often thought of as amateurs. Determined to succeed and refusing to be boxed in, they daringly painted what were usually thought to be subjects for male artists: history pieces, battle scenes and the nude.The exhibition sheds light on how these artists championed equal access to art training and academy membership, breaking boundaries and overcoming many obstacles to establish what it meant to be a woman in the art world.In partnership with Lockton", "Explore the groundbreaking work of a circle of friends and close collaborators known as The Blue Rider.

Built in 1968 to alleviate London\u2019s housing shortage, Thamesmead was one of many modernist large-scale housing projects constructed across Europe after the Second World War. Smith talked to a number of local residents, from some of its very first occupants to young people growing up during the Covid-19 pandemic. He then turned their conversations into the 24 painted placards you can see here. Reflecting on the work, Smith said \u2018I thought I was making a painting about a housing estate, but actually I\u2019ve been painting about the desire to be heard.\u2019\u2018Codex\u2019, from the title Thamesmead Codex, is an ancient term for a manuscript or book. Here, the artist presents a modern-day version. The work documents the histories and identities of Thamesmead and its communities. It records memories from the past, and hopes for a post-Covid future. Alongside this record of people\u2019s thoughts and experiences, Smith includes vivid and futuristic landscape scenes much like illustrated pages of a codex.Bob and Roberta Smith (whose real name is Patrick Brill) brings together sign writing, activism and discarded materials. Talking about his practice, he says he sees \u2018art as an important element in democratic life.\u2019", "Zanele Muholi is one of the most acclaimed photographers working today, and their work has been exhibited all over the world.

From the early 2000s, they have documented and celebrated the lives of South Africa\u2019s Black lesbian, gay, trans, queer and intersex communities.In the early series Only Half the Picture, Muholi captures moments of love and intimacy as well as intense images alluding to traumatic events \u2013 despite the equality promised by South Africa\u2019s 1996 constitution, its LGBTQIA+ community remains a target for violence and prejudice.In Faces and Phases each participant looks directly at the camera, challenging the viewer to hold their gaze. These images and the accompanying testimonies form a growing archive of a community of people who are risking their lives by living authentically in the face of oppression and discrimination.Other key series of works, include Brave Beauties, which celebrates empowered non-binary people and trans women, many of whom have won Miss Gay Beauty pageants, and Being, a series of tender images of couples which challenge stereotypes and taboos.Muholi turns the camera on themself in the ongoing series Somnyama Ngonyama \u2013 translated as \u2018Hail the Dark Lioness\u2019.

Ofili considered the significance of painting directly onto the walls of a public building and wanted to choose a subject that affected us as a nation. Requiem is a dream-like mural, resulting from his poetic reflections.Ofili met fellow artist Khadija Saye in May 2017 when they were both exhibiting in Venice. One month later, Saye died in the Grenfell Tower fire. Memories of their meeting had a profound impact on Ofili. It helped him find a path to create this work, which holds at its centre an image of Saye as a \u2018powerful creative force of transformation.\u2019When making this artwork, Ofili recalled the feelings he had when he made No Woman, No Cry in 1998 (The work is on display in Room 26 at Tate Britain). No Woman, No Cry is a tribute to Stephen Lawrence and his mother, Doreen. Stephen was murdered in a racially motivated attack in 1993. For Ofili, \u2018a statement of sadness was manifested in No Woman, No Cry. That feeling of injustice has returned.\u2019\u2018I wanted to make a work in tribute to Khadija Saye.

It starts with the dismantling of the famous myth of Narcissus to demonstrate how the narcissistic network operates \u2013 intimate or global \u2013 and reveals how Narcissus became the scapegoat for the entire system, hiding the true source of covert and intolerant power. The resemblance between familial and institutional narcissism continues through a presentation of art, literature, film, and theory, involving discussions with feminists, psychologists, and Africanists, as well as interviews with women artists in Nigeria who have used the power of the collective as a means of combat. Finally, the psychological impact of such trauma is explored, and key concepts that reveal how victims of such abuse can be perpetually re-targeted.\"", "This major survey of work by over 100 women artists working in the UK will be the first of its kind.

These performances re-enact the original presentation of the work in 1971, when a cellist sat on a chair next to the painting at the Modern Art Agency gallery in Naples and interpreted the excerpt by playing it repeatedly over several minutes.For these performances, the cellist will play for about five minutes, then pause for around ten minutes and then start again.Kounellis\u2019 early paintings of the 1960s were inspired by words and graphics found in street signs. He connected his practice with performance from the very start, thinking of the words and letters he painted as poems or scores to read out loud. He later introduced music in his paintings, installations and performances.Kounellis often used the theme of music to reconcile memory with the present moment. The work Untitled 1971, which remains on display with an empty chair during the rest of the week, represents both a record of the original performance and the potential for it to be reactivated. Even without the musical accompaniment, we can read the score in our minds or imagine the music being played.The score Kounellis reproduced on this painting is an excerpt from Bach\u2019s oratorio St John Passion, originally composed in 1723\u20134. An oratorio is a musical composition for orchestra, choir and soloists, with lyrics based on the Bible or the lives of saints. Kounellis chose to reproduce a fragment of a musical piece with its own history, which can also play a role in an expanded understanding of the piece as activated by the public\u2019s imagination.Greek-born artist Jannis Kounellis (1936\u20132017) moved to Rome in 1956, where he became a central figure of arte povera. Artists associated with this movement used ordinary materials of both natural and industrial origins, hoping to bring the experience of art closer to everyday life.", "People and communities are at the heart of RESOLVE Collective\u2019s exhibitions.

It is divided into three chapters,\u202fNest Type,\u202fNest Site\u202fand\u202fMaterial, concluding with a post-script on the bowerbird, the only known bird to make a structure for display only.Throughout the film, Holden and his father adopt different positions on the significance of birds\u2019 nests. His father considers them from a scientific perspective, reflecting on inherited traits and learned behaviours. Holden examines them as sculptural objects, suggesting comparisons between nest building and making art.\u202fThe scripted exchange combines ironic humour with profound conversations on the nature of creativity and the parental bond.The work began as a series of performative lectures given by Holden and his father at museums, festivals and universities across the UK. Posters designed for these events are shown alongside the video work in this one room display, alongside childhood photographs of Holden taken by his father and original or re-made specimens from his collection of nests.", "An artist's book is conceived by an artist as a work of art, though it may not be physically made by them. It is usually cheaply produced, so that many copies can be made and widely circulated. In this way artists' books are different from many other kinds of artwork, in which uniqueness is an important factor.Since the 1950s, artists have used books to engage with audiences directly. Often they have asked readers and viewers to reflect not only on the publication itself, but also on the way it has come into their hands. How the books are distributed can raise questions about ownership and art as commodity. Artists' books also have a complex status as both artworks in themselves and documentation. Their place within the museum \u2013 and art history more widely \u2013 is not fixed.In recent decades, artists\u2019 publications have explored the entangled, evolving relationship between printed books and digital media. Technology has transformed how artists make and distribute publications, and how they understand them. Amid the explosion of digital content, what is a book today and what can it do?Tate Library holds a large, international collection of artists\u2019 books, together with a wide range of other art publications. Displayed around the room are treasures from Tate Archive, documenting key developments in British art across the 20th century. Tate Archive contains over 20 million pieces, and is now the world\u2019s largest archive for British art.To make an appointment to view Library and Archive items in the Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms at Tate Britain email reading.rooms@tate.org.uk.", "Jannis Kounellis (1936\u20132017) was born in the Greek port city of Piraeus, but lived and worked in Rome from 1956. His early paintings were inspired by words and graphics found in street signs, which he gradually reduced to letters, numbers and basic symbols arranged over plain backgrounds. Though he soon expanded his practice to include performance and sculpture, he considered himself primarily a painter. Whether making pictures or using materials and objects that share the same space as us as viewers, he aimed to create powerful images, mundane and strange at the same time.In the late 1960s Kounellis became a key figure of the Italian arte povera (\u2018poor art\u2019) movement. Artists associated with arte povera used ordinary materials of both natural and industrial origins and hoped to bring the experience of art closer to everyday life. At the time, Italy was undergoing a period of rapid social change, torn between industrial and agrarian life, tradition and innovation, antiquity and modernity. Kounellis\u2019s works express this clash of values by bringing together contrasting elements such as raw wood and steel beams, or strings of colourful glass hanging next to a mound of black coal.Many of Kounellis\u2019s installations subtly change the architecture of the gallery, like the stones blocking the passage between two rooms. Some suggest the presence and actions of people: in a work bringing together painting, sculpture and performance, an empty chair lies waiting for a cellist to play a painted musical score. Other works carry strong associations both sensorial and cultural, like those including bells and coffee beans. These objects have a rich history, evoking sounds and smells familiar to many.", "These rooms start with the oldest artworks in Tate's collection.

Sometimes the work takes the form of a proposal for an action or the record of a past event or performance. Elsewhere viewers are invited to activate an artwork using their bodies. Artworks shown here include a mix of intimate individual acts, choreographed actions in which participants are directed by an artist and political activism.", "For the first time, five of Mark Rothko\u2019s Seagram murals are being shown at Tate St Ives.In 1958, the American artist Mark Rothko accepted a commission to produce a series of large paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building, New York. He was interested in having a permanent setting where the works could always be shown as a group and in an immersive environment. He constructed a scaffold in his studio to match the exact dimensions of the restaurant and set to work.In the Summer of 1959, Rothko took a break from working on the murals to travel to Europe with his family. He visited Cornwall, invited by artist Peter Lanyon, and met many like-minded artists including Alan Davie, Paul Feiler and Terry Frost, some who feature in Tate St Ives\u2019s current displays.Upon his return to the United States, Rothko decided that the restaurant would not be an appropriate location for his painting. He donated nine of them to Tate in 1969.The Seagram murals were a significant departure for Rothko. The intense, bright colours of his earlier paintings gave way to maroon, dark red and black. Rothko wished to create a deep connection between the viewer and his paintings:I am interested only in expressing basic human emotions \u2013 tragedy, ecstasy, doomThis one-room display includes five of the nine murals in the Tate collection. Presented, as the artist intended, in a single space with reduced light, these works offer a meditative conclusion to the exhibitions and displays at Tate St Ives.Mark Rothko (1903\u20131970) was born in Russia.

Even when he moved to the countryside near Edinburgh he was never far from a body of water - such as the ponds in his celebrated garden, Little Sparta, in Dunsyre.Finlay began his career publishing plays, short stories and poems in the mid-1950s. His early works were important contributions to the development of concrete poetry, a form of visual poetry where the arrangement of words and letters is as significant as their meaning. Finlay published his first collection of concrete poems in 1963, and at the end of the 1960s he began making sculptures. The works on display here illustrate these two practices. They generate poetic associations by juxtaposing words, images and materials.Finlay often collaborated with other artists and craftspeople, who he always credited in his publications and exhibitions. In 1961, he founded the Wild Hawthorn Press. This publishing company produced versions of many of Finlay\u2019s artworks across a range of mediums. Included here are a series of screenprinted ceramic tiles, suggesting ways to experience visual poetry in a domestic environment. The use of tiles in kitchen and bathroom \u2018wet rooms\u2019 also playfully chimes with their maritime subject matter.", "This display introduces you to some of the best-loved artworks in the Tate collection. Linked by themes such as colour, these rooms with highlight artworks from a range of countries, cultures and times.", "Originally made for the entrance of Tate Britain, this neon wall sculpture presents a text in the form of an equation. While the\u00a0use of an equation suggests a definitive formula, Creed\u2019s words remains ambiguous. It has been interpreted as both a positive statement about the inclusiveness of art, and a negative statement about art\u2019s\u00a0irrelevance.", "People have used language as an expressive art form for millennia, from oral tradition and the spoken word, to illuminated manuscripts and printed publications. This room brings together works produced in the last 50 years in Europe and the USA. They demonstrate different ways of engaging with text and its role as a form of communication.By the late 1960s, text was the primary focus of many visual artworks. Artists associated with movements like cubism and Pop Art had long incorporated words found in advertising and mass media. Those interested in concrete poetry (such as Ian Hamilton Finlay) and conceptual art (such as Lawrence Weiner) often made artworks from text alone.Many of the works in this room respond directly to the proliferation of language and text in the information age, particularly in relation to consumerism. For some artists, text provides a unique way to translate and materialise their ideas. Others reflect on language as an expression of human culture, capable of transmitting ideas, influencing behaviour and memorialising people and events.Some of these artists focus on the act of writing as a form of making: inscribing, painting, carving, scribbling, typing or embroidering words as personal, meditative and poetic acts. For many, text-based works are a way to actively engage viewers. The reader is invited to imagine what is only described, and to project their own memories and associations onto the artist\u2019s words.", "The electric lightbulbs of this sculpture spell out a phrase that is both a spectacle and a public statement. Standing in the landscape outside Tate Modern opposite the high-rise buildings in the City of London, the words seem to be urging us to act.Nathan Coley takes his words from the satirical novella Candide (1759) by the French writer and philosopher Voltaire (1694\u20131778). Voltaire\u2019s story of a young man who travels the world in search of happiness concludes with this ambiguous sentence. Coley has commented: \u2018I think my work has a sense of politics and a sense of the world and also a kind of sense of humour.\u2019This display is supported by Dasha and William Shenkman in memory of their mother Belle Shenkman (1928 \u20131995) a passionate patron, and promoter of the arts, and by Tate Enterprises.", "This wing is concerned with the ways in which artists engage with social ideals and historical realities. Though some artists associated modernism with a utopian vision, art has also provided a mirror to contemporary society, sometimes raising awareness about urgent issues or arguing for change. Whether through traditional media or moving images, abstraction or figuration, militancy or detached observation, all the artworks in this wing highlight aspects of the social reality in which they were made, and try to generate a reaction and convey a more or less explicit message to their publics.", "The Tanks provide a permanent gallery for live art, performances and film and video work from the Tate collection. There is also a programme of new commissions of works made for the specific spaces.The Tanks were previously used to store oil when the gallery was a power station. These huge circular spaces in the foundations of the Blavatnik Building have kept their rough, industrial feel to now house new art. No longer generating electricity, the Tanks generate ideas, creative energy and new possibilities for artists and audiences. These raw, industrial, subterranean spaces, each measuring over thirty metres across and seven metres high are the world\u2019s first museum galleries permanently dedicated to exhibiting live art, performance, installation and film."], "urls": ["https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/women-in-revolt", "https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/el-anatsui",
