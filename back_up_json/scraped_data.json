It explores how he worked like a stylist to craft the image of the sitters he painted, who he often had close relationships with.Sargent used fashion as a powerful tool to express identity and personality. He regularly chose the outfits of his collaborators or manipulated their clothing. This innovative use of costume was central to his artwork \u2013 for example, tugging a heavy coat tighter around a man to emphasise his figure or letting a dress strap sensuously slip from a woman\u2019s shoulder. It was these daring sartorial choices that allowed him to express his vision as an artist.Almost 60 of Sargent\u2019s paintings will be on display, including major portraits that rarely travel. Several period garments will also be showcased alongside the portraits they were worn in. The show examines how this remarkable painter used fashion to create portraits of the time, which still captivate today.Lead support with a generous donation from the Blavatnik Family Foundation.

The exhibition Beatriz Milhazes: Maresias traces the evolution of her artistic approach over the past four decades.Beatriz Milhazes (born 1960, Rio de Janeiro) rose to prominence in the 1980s as a leading figure of the Gera\u00e7\u00e3o Oitenta (1980s Generation), a pivotal Brazilian art movement that saw a return to painting as a dynamic medium for artistic expression, moving away from the conceptual art of the previous decade.Milhazes is influenced by multiple sources including Brazilian and European modernism, Catholic iconography, Baroque colonial architecture, and the vernacular culture and heritage of Brazil.Adapting the concept of collage to painting, Milhazes creates exuberant, densely layered works. In 1989 she developed her distinctive \u2018monotransfer\u2019 technique in which she paints her own motifs onto plastic sheeting before transposing them onto canvas. This process offers the possibility to retain the fidelity of the colours and intensify the effects of fluorescent and metallic pigments. It also allows Milhazes to create a smooth and defiant surface without losing the painterly quality.In Portuguese, Maresias refers to the salty sea breeze that is part of Milhazes\u2019 everyday life in the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, where she lives and works. Nature is an enduring and increasingly important theme, and she finds inspiration in the landscapes around her studio, as well as in the forms and structures of the natural world.Organised by and originated at Turner Contemporary, Margate, and adapted for presentation at Tate St Ives.", "Spanning 400 years, this exhibition follows women on their journeys to becoming professional artists. From Tudor times to the First World War, artists such as Mary Beale, Angelica Kauffman, Elizabeth Butler and Laura Knight paved a new artistic path for generations of women.

Determined to succeed and refusing to be boxed in, they daringly painted what were usually thought to be subjects for male artists: history pieces, battle scenes and the nude.The exhibition sheds light on how these artists championed equal access to art training and academy membership, breaking boundaries and overcoming many obstacles to establish what it meant to be a woman in the art world.In partnership with Lockton", "Explore the groundbreaking work of a circle of friends and close collaborators known as The Blue Rider.

Ofili considered the significance of painting directly onto the walls of a public building and wanted to choose a subject that affected us as a nation. Requiem is a dream-like mural, resulting from his poetic reflections.Ofili met fellow artist Khadija Saye in May 2017 when they were both exhibiting in Venice.

These performances re-enact the original presentation of the work in 1971, when a cellist sat on a chair next to the painting at the Modern Art Agency gallery in Naples and interpreted the excerpt by playing it repeatedly over several minutes.For these performances, the cellist will play for about five minutes, then pause for around ten minutes and then start again.Kounellis\u2019 early paintings of the 1960s were inspired by words and graphics found in street signs. He connected his practice with performance from the very start, thinking of the words and letters he painted as poems or scores to read out loud. He later introduced music in his paintings, installations and performances.Kounellis often used the theme of music to reconcile memory with the present moment. The work Untitled 1971, which remains on display with an empty chair during the rest of the week, represents both a record of the original performance and the potential for it to be reactivated. Even without the musical accompaniment, we can read the score in our minds or imagine the music being played.The score Kounellis reproduced on this painting is an excerpt from Bach\u2019s oratorio St John Passion, originally composed in 1723\u20134. An oratorio is a musical composition for orchestra, choir and soloists, with lyrics based on the Bible or the lives of saints. Kounellis chose to reproduce a fragment of a musical piece with its own history, which can also play a role in an expanded understanding of the piece as activated by the public\u2019s imagination.Greek-born artist Jannis Kounellis (1936\u20132017) moved to Rome in 1956, where he became a central figure of arte povera. Artists associated with this movement used ordinary materials of both natural and industrial origins, hoping to bring the experience of art closer to everyday life.", "People and communities are at the heart of RESOLVE Collective\u2019s exhibitions.

It is usually cheaply produced, so that many copies can be made and widely circulated. In this way artists' books are different from many other kinds of artwork, in which uniqueness is an important factor.Since the 1950s, artists have used books to engage with audiences directly. Often they have asked readers and viewers to reflect not only on the publication itself, but also on the way it has come into their hands. How the books are distributed can raise questions about ownership and art as commodity. Artists' books also have a complex status as both artworks in themselves and documentation. Their place within the museum \u2013 and art history more widely \u2013 is not fixed.In recent decades, artists\u2019 publications have explored the entangled, evolving relationship between printed books and digital media. Technology has transformed how artists make and distribute publications, and how they understand them. Amid the explosion of digital content, what is a book today and what can it do?Tate Library holds a large, international collection of artists\u2019 books, together with a wide range of other art publications. Displayed around the room are treasures from Tate Archive, documenting key developments in British art across the 20th century.

His early paintings were inspired by words and graphics found in street signs, which he gradually reduced to letters, numbers and basic symbols arranged over plain backgrounds. Though he soon expanded his practice to include performance and sculpture, he considered himself primarily a painter. Whether making pictures or using materials and objects that share the same space as us as viewers, he aimed to create powerful images, mundane and strange at the same time.In the late 1960s Kounellis became a key figure of the Italian arte povera (\u2018poor art\u2019) movement. Artists associated with arte povera used ordinary materials of both natural and industrial origins and hoped to bring the experience of art closer to everyday life. At the time, Italy was undergoing a period of rapid social change, torn between industrial and agrarian life, tradition and innovation, antiquity and modernity. Kounellis\u2019s works express this clash of values by bringing together contrasting elements such as raw wood and steel beams, or strings of colourful glass hanging next to a mound of black coal.Many of Kounellis\u2019s installations subtly change the architecture of the gallery, like the stones blocking the passage between two rooms. Some suggest the presence and actions of people: in a work bringing together painting, sculpture and performance, an empty chair lies waiting for a cellist to play a painted musical score. Other works carry strong associations both sensorial and cultural, like those including bells and coffee beans. These objects have a rich history, evoking sounds and smells familiar to many.", "These rooms start with the oldest artworks in Tate's collection.

Sometimes the work takes the form of a proposal for an action or the record of a past event or performance. Elsewhere viewers are invited to activate an artwork using their bodies. Artworks shown here include a mix of intimate individual acts, choreographed actions in which participants are directed by an artist and political activism.", "For the first time, five of Mark Rothko\u2019s Seagram murals are being shown at Tate St Ives.In 1958, the American artist Mark Rothko accepted a commission to produce a series of large paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building, New York. He was interested in having a permanent setting where the works could always be shown as a group and in an immersive environment. He constructed a scaffold in his studio to match the exact dimensions of the restaurant and set to work.In the Summer of 1959, Rothko took a break from working on the murals to travel to Europe with his family. He visited Cornwall, invited by artist Peter Lanyon, and met many like-minded artists including Alan Davie, Paul Feiler and Terry Frost, some who feature in Tate St Ives\u2019s current displays.Upon his return to the United States, Rothko decided that the restaurant would not be an appropriate location for his painting. He donated nine of them to Tate in 1969.The Seagram murals were a significant departure for Rothko. The intense, bright colours of his earlier paintings gave way to maroon, dark red and black. Rothko wished to create a deep connection between the viewer and his paintings:I am interested only in expressing basic human emotions \u2013 tragedy, ecstasy, doomThis one-room display includes five of the nine murals in the Tate collection. Presented, as the artist intended, in a single space with reduced light, these works offer a meditative conclusion to the exhibitions and displays at Tate St Ives.Mark Rothko (1903\u20131970) was born in Russia.

It investigates the colours and sounds of different cultures through their literal building blocks.", "In the late 1960s, Lawrence Weiner contributed to the development of conceptual art. The movement proposed that ideas, or concepts, could be experienced as artworks even without a physical form. In 1969, Weiner summarised the principles underlying his art in what he called his \u2018Declaration of Intent\u2019:", "Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay created the poem-objects in this room between the 1960s and 1990s. They focus on maritime themes like boats, fishing and seafaring. The sea was a recurring source of inspiration for Finlay. He was born in The Bahamas and lived for a brief but formative time on Rousay, one of the Scottish Orkney Islands. Even when he moved to the countryside near Edinburgh he was never far from a body of water - such as the ponds in his celebrated garden, Little Sparta, in Dunsyre.Finlay began his career publishing plays, short stories and poems in the mid-1950s. His early works were important contributions to the development of concrete poetry, a form of visual poetry where the arrangement of words and letters is as significant as their meaning. Finlay published his first collection of concrete poems in 1963, and at the end of the 1960s he began making sculptures. The works on display here illustrate these two practices. They generate poetic associations by juxtaposing words, images and materials.Finlay often collaborated with other artists and craftspeople, who he always credited in his publications and exhibitions. In 1961, he founded the Wild Hawthorn Press. This publishing company produced versions of many of Finlay\u2019s artworks across a range of mediums. Included here are a series of screenprinted ceramic tiles, suggesting ways to experience visual poetry in a domestic environment. The use of tiles in kitchen and bathroom \u2018wet rooms\u2019 also playfully chimes with their maritime subject matter.", "Agnes Martin was a key figure in the male-dominated field of abstract art in the USA. In the 1950s and 1960s her work was often associated with abstract expressionism and minimalism. However, Martin\u2019s methods were different. In her meticulous, hand-painted artworks, ordered geometry and imperfection co-existed.The paintings in this room consist of horizontal bands of colour, divided by delicate pencil lines. The bands initially appear uniform, but on closer inspection, faint brushstrokes and pools of paint emerge. These marks give the artworks a hand-made feel, undermining the rigid geometry of the composition. As Martin said, \u2018the work is about perfection as we are aware of it in our minds but... the paintings are very far from being perfect \u2013 completely removed in fact \u2013 even as we ourselves are.'Martin\u2019s work was influenced by Zen Buddhism and Chinese Tao philosophy. Her paintings explore the inner emotional world and the human desire for peace and serenity. She considered art to be a transcendent experience. She explained, \u2018Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not just in the eye. It is in the mind. It is our positive response to life\u2019.ARTIST ROOMS is a touring collection of over 1,600 works of modern and contemporary art.
